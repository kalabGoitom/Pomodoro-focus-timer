# Pomodoro Focus Timer 

A clean and minimal Pomodoro timer built with vanilla JavaScript, designed to help improve focus and productivity using structured work and break cycles.

This project was built from scratch without frameworks to strengthen core JavaScript skills such as state management, timing logic, and DOM manipulation.

##  Features

-  Customizable focus and break durations  
-  Automatic focus → break cycle switching  
-  Focus session tracking (total focused minutes)  
-  Dark mode friendly UI  
-  Clean and simple user experience  
-  Prevents multiple timers from running at once  

---

##  Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

No libraries. No frameworks. Just core fundamentals.

##  How It Works

1. Set your desired focus and break time  
2. Start the timer  
3. Focus session runs → automatically switches to break  
4. Completed focus time is tracked and displayed  
5. Repeat   

All timing logic is handled using a single interval and derived state to ensure accuracy and stability.

- Managing time-based state with JavaScript  
- Preventing interval duplication bugs  
- Designing UI updates from application state  
- Structuring logic in a scalable way (React-ready)

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Pause / resume functionality  
- Sound notifications  
- Local storage support  
- React version of the app
